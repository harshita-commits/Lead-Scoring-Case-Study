##   Developed a Logistic Regression model to assign lead scores, helping X Education target potential leads effectively, achieving an 83.65% conversion rate on the test set.


## Key Methodologies:

## Data Cleaning and Preparation: 

Removed redundant variables, handled missing values, and created dummy variables for categorical features.

## Model Building: 

Utilized Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and p-value analysis to identify significant features. Achieved an 88% area under the ROC curve.

## Insights Gained: 

Identified critical lead points for maximizing conversion, such as occupation, time spent on the website, and lead source.


This summary encapsulates the approach and outcomes of the analysis conducted to enhance X Education's lead conversion process.
